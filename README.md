Vintage computers, video game systems, and electronics tend to use very large decoupling capacitors. You can find them next to linear regulators, like the venrable LM7805. Often if the cap is more than 1,000 uF, it is an axial form factor.

Axial form factor means the leads or electrodes come out of the "top" and "bottom" of the capacitor, allowing it to be laid-down on the PCB. This reduces the height.

Unfortuantely, no manufacturer today makes polymer aluminum electrolytics in a axial form factor. These are my preferred capacitor for re-capping since they have significantly lower-ESR and are solid. So there is no electrolyte to ever leak-out and damage the cirucit boards.

The Axial Polymer BAC-Adapter converts modern surface mount polymers into a vintage axial format. 

The size of this design is 53.4 x 13.1 mm and can hold 4 10x10.5 mm surface mount capacitors. It should fit in a VIC-20 and Commodore 64. (Still need to test.)

Boards are currently being manufacturered.
